 two new u k tax relief measures for oil producers announced today are aimed at encouraging developments in the north sea to go ahead and boost opportunities for the offshore supplies industry the inland revenue said in a post budget statement earlier chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced in his annual budget to parliament that from today companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against petroleum revenue tax prt to date full relief was allowed for expenditure on an individual field itself when its income stream began but was not immediately available against other development expenditure the statement said the new relief will apply to fields outside the southern basin for which development consent is first given on or after today and will improve the post tax economics of new developments and encourage companies to proceed with project which might have been delayed it said lawson also announced that he would henceforth allow certain expenditure on oil related research which does not at present qualify for prt relief to be offset against prt liability this means oil related expenditure in the u k or on the u k continental shelf which has not become allowable in a particular field within three years of being incurred to be allowed against prt liability in any oil field the inland revenue said this brings the scope of prt relief for research costs more in line with corporation tax relief measures and is planned to encourage general research into ways of reducing field development costs it said in due course the industry should benefit by over 100 mln stg a year it calculated the inland revenue statement also included other technical measures that lawson did not comment on in his budget speech these included measures to allow companies to balance their shares of prt exempt oil allowances through reallocation in two past periods of allowance utilisation tidier rules on incorrectly allowed prt expenditure reliefs were announced while there were also ammendments on rules on corporation tax and advance corporation tax relating to the so called ring fence of activities in the u k and its continental shelf the finance bill will have provisions for the implementation of measures announced in november it said gareth lewis davies a north sea expert with stockbrokers wood mackenzie and co inc in edinburgh thought the two reliefs on prt would help the depressed offshore industry he said the 10 pct cross field allowance relief would favour chances that development of smaller north sea fields such osprey don and arbroath would be brought forward early development of the larger miller and bruce oil fields might also be encouraged he said lewis davies said the measure might also aid the offshore construction industry which suffered a huge amount of lay offs under the price slump of more than 50 pct last year he pointed out that the relief only applies to the development of new fields outside the southern basin this means more jobs could be created as the fields in the central and northern sectors of the north sea are deeper than in the south and thus have greater capital and labour requirements as the waters are deeper than in the south he said the prt relief for certain research expenditure would help fundamental research in the oil industry although the benefits of this research would not be seen for several year reuter 3

 national bank of hungary first vice president janos fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year's severe trade deficit with the west fekete told reuters in an interview hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade it is useful to have a devaluation he said there is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports the official news agency mti said today hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow he said one reason for the devaluation was that hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5 5 pct in 1986 this was partly an after effect of action hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s he added hungary devalued by a similar amount last september and by between three and four pct early last year but the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539 4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295 3 mln in 1986 and 1 2 billion in 1985 fekete said hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs one western commercial attache here said devaluation of itself will not change anything it will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry it would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process he noted hungary had been given an aa rating enabling it to raise money on the japanese samurai bond market hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7 79 billion dlrs last year from 5 01 billion in 1985 partly because of a current account deficit of 1 42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen he said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation i am for credits to invest for that purpose he said i am against credits for consumption he forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year from one pct in 1986 fekete said hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market where he considered rates to be low hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3 5 billion dlrs he said on the budget deficit which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985 fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43 8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints reuter 3

 the soviet union's winter grain crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting conditions last fall and severe cold this winter an analyst of world weather and crop conditions said grain analyst and meteorologist gail martell author of the ef hutton publication global crop news said in her latest report that the soviets may import more grain possibly wheat from the u s due to potential crop damage compared with last year the outlook for the soviet winter grain crop is far more pessimistic she said but it's still too early to talk about disastrous losses a lot will depend on spring weather not only for the outcome of the troubled winter grain crop but also for spring planting martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains key wheat growing areas of the southern ukraine and north caucasus received on 25 35 pct of autumn precipitation she said the bitter winter cold temperatures which broke record lows that had stood for four decades also may have taken its toll on soviet winter crops she said however she noted that most of the southern grain belt had ample snow cover which should have well insulated the majority of crop areas from severe frost damage the ussr has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains in the july 1986 june 1987 marketing year primarily from canada the european community argentina and australia martell said she cited a number of reasons besides possible crop problems that might point to additional soviet import demand last fall's dry weather may limit livestock grazing on moisture depleted pastures while the cold winter weather necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy martell was also skeptical of a soviet claim for a 1986 grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes and said the chernobyl accident may have contaminated more grain than originally thought and have to be made up with imports however she said the u s remains a supplier of last resort for the soviet union noting that the soviets have only just recently begun their first u s grain purchases of the 1986 87 season by buying 2 25 mln tonnes of corn martell cited usda statistics showing that since the 1980 grain embargo the u s is only a major supplier of grain to the ussr during years of heavy soviet demand in 1984 85 the u s supplied 41 pct of record soviet grain imports of 55 5 mln tonnes but in 1985 86 the soviet union bought 29 9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the u s for only 24 pct of that total while the usda soviet import target for grain for 1986 87 was 22 mln tonnes many u s grain analysts have revised their estimates of soviet imports up to 25 28 mln tonnes she said reuter 3

 lack of rainfall in recent weeks may have affected ivory coast 1987 88 main crop cocoa prospects although good precipitation in the last half of june and in july could still reverse the situation trade sources said they said the crop is still likely to be fairly large and it is too early to determine the consequences of the dry spell on the harvest this year's crop will probably be another good one it is impossible to tell how flowering is going but there should be no problems unless something drastic happens one trader said private forecaster accu weather reported today that most ivory coast cocoa growing regions were without rain over the weekend and similar weather will persist today and tuesday rain would be welcomed as the past week has been quite dry except along the western portion of the coast it said traders agreed rain was needed but some noted that the dry conditions had not affected the entire country the ivorian meteorological office could not be reached for comment or recent statistics the trade sources said rainfall in recent weeks was likely insufficient for cocoa plants although it is difficult to assess what the minimum requirements are trade sources said there had been good rains in late january february and march which helped to promote flowering but april and may were fairly dry in most areas except in the south west of the country the ivory coast mid crop should have been covered by march april rains but the main crop still in its formation period depends largely on rainfall from april through july the main rains normally last between may and july before returning again in september october flowering has been less than normal and if the trees are not carrying that much at the moment then they have a chance to recover one trader said another trade source noted the flowers still had plenty of time to develop and the rains were not good but still not bad the sources said that while the weather might emerge as a cause for concern crop conditions in west africa were presently taking a back seat to other factors in the international cocoa market this is not only because of the premature nature of any harvest predictions but also because of the supply of cocoa already burdening the market they said with a third year of surplus overhanging the market and the buffer stock failing to boost prices despite regular purchases the weather has not been a factor one private consultant said london based dealer gill and duffus said in its april cocoa market report the current 1986 87 ivory coast crop was likely to total 570 000 tonnes which compares with a record 1985 86 crop estimate of 585 000 tonnes reuter 3

 australia's crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly based approach federal resources and energy minister gareth evans told a meeting here he told the australian petroleum exploration association apea annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government's economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years these include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on 'old' bass strait oil found before september 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last september he said the industry through the apea has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and australia's relatively low exploration levels while nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime i am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes which leave government revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas evans said he said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation rrt legislation now before parliament in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible as previously reported rrt is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects apea has said it is not a true profit based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects evans said the decision not to change rrt was based more than anything on the government's desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules reuter 3

 venezuela's central bank has ordered venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange operations with brokers based outside the country according to a copy of a central bank telex made available to reuters the measure confirmed by a brokerage firm here has effectively cut off all foreign participation in venezuela's volatile currency market the telex issued on may 19 was signed by carlos hernandez delfino manager of the bank's department of international operations the telex said the restriction on business with foreign brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign currencies to anyone living outside venezuela in recent weeks the venezuelan government has denied rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to prop up the weakening bolivar but brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de facto currency control it is definitely a control in the sense that there's no longer complete freedom to operate one broker here said gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction is towards complete control the broker said the broker who requested anonymity said virtually all his venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with telephone calls he said that before the restriction was imposed the volume of his firm's transactions with venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs a day it was a frenetic market it was really quite active he said the broker said he saw no logical explanation for the prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary between venezuelan brokers exchange houses and banks we weren't buying dollars from venezuelans that's ridiculous he said they've been on a rampage against foreigners the broker noted that two months ago venezuela's central bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange business outside venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct reserve requirement in february the central bank also prohibited trading in bolivar futures the broker said we used to have a forward market he said for a small currency it was miraculous he said the bolivar which averaged 20 29 to the u s dollar in 1986 would continue to slip from its current range of 28 35 to 28 50 because the central bank was rapidly running out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free market reuter 3

 a spokesman for preussag ag lt prsg f said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results he was commenting on a preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985 preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985 managing board chairman guenther sassmannshausen said in december the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends the spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board the preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group's other divisions the spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986 adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65 0 mln marks from 103 0 mln the year before the preussag world group made a net loss of 13 1 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 154 5 mln the year before domestic group net profit fell to 77 9 mln from 122 2 mln the statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector the reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4 48 billion marks in 1986 from 4 29 billion in 1985 helped by the first time consolidation of 951 8 mln marks of turnover from its majority owned oil and gas subsidiary c deilmann ag domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 1 1 billion marks it said without giving comparison figures preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4 0 pct to 94 400 tonnes in 1986 while foreign oil production rose to 182 900 tonnes from 174 500 tonnes preussag said its amalgamated metal corporation plc amc subsidiary whose results are included in the world group accounts made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year amc's large losses in 1985 caused principally by the international tin crisis were the reason behind the world group losses that year reuter 3

 the chairman of the federal reserve board paul volcker has written to the chairman of the house banking committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration wednesday volcker told committee chairman fernand st germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant u s firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against u s firms abroad he added even japan against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed has started opening its markets in his letter made available at the treasury volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks was a problem i believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt volcker said it might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries he said volcker said he endorsed comments by treasury secretary james baker about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility he also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects for example the bill's directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations volcker said he recommended we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations on exchange rates but instead use other more flexible means like the recent mmeting in paris between u s treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies reuter 3

 a voluntary compliance system for monitoring u s coffee imports under quotas is viewed skeptically by many in the coffee industry said analysts and trade sources many sectors of the trade including large roasters and importers are adamant against voluntary compliance because of the past which was subject to tremendous irregularities as it became a matter of the trade monitoring each other one analyst said on monday a national coffee association newsletter said the office of u s trade representative will implement a voluntary compliance system temporarily because legislation to monitor imports is tied up in the congressional trade bill under the arrangement milar to one in 1980 coffee importers would voluntarily present needed documents to the u s government until congress approves the monitoring authority but if coffee arrives without valid certification it will still be allowed entry while many believe producers will not seek to add to the overburdened stock situation in the u s others believe some will ship outside of the quota requirements in lieu of monitoring controls trade sources said last time there was a lot of false information submitted to customs which resulted in a lot of indictments and fines a u s customs spokesman said customs can do a good job when given the tools but when its hands are tied it doesn't have the authority to demand form o documents tracking merchandise from source to destination he said many see it as a true test of whether producers and importers will abide by the quota system it is a key to seeing whether there are any teeth in the quota agreement said one major u s roaster last time we had a gentleman's agreement the trade did not act as a gentleman said another analyst adding without the need to submit documents the ball will be in the producers' hands some feel that importers will take advantage of the voluntary compliance due to development of a two tier market in which non member countries buy coffee at a big discount many fear that dealers will buy coffee destined for non member countries at discounts and then bring it into the u s falsely labelled according to customs officials several green coffee importers confessed in 1985 that they had imported coffee fraudulently after buying it for non member destinations forging landing certificates and then relabelling it as navy beans if there's that much of a discrepancy between prices for one country and another producers may be teted to get rid of their stocks of coffee by selling to non member nations and by circumventing the quota provisions said paine webber analyst bernie savaiko still others believe that producers will not be hard pressed to aggravate the overburdened coffee stock situation in the u s in the near term it would be naive to suggest that any agreement would not have some share of connivance but i think the voluntary system seemed to suffice and coupled with the fact that we have so much coffee i don't think that it poses that much of a threat one trader said reuter 3

 switzerland's economy combining low unemployment financial stability and a large external payments surplus is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd said this reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government it said the oecd in its annual report on switzerland picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick up in inflation this year but said these gave no cause for concern the study forecast a decline in gross domestic product growth to 1 75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1 25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0 75 pct from 3 6 pct in 1985 but it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct the lowest in the 24 industrial nation oecd area assuming an average exchange rate of 1 71 swiss francs to the dollar this year against 1 69 in the second half of 1986 the report forecast a 2 75 pct rise in exports and a 3 5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3 25 pct and 6 5 pct respectively in 1986 the faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last reflecting buoyant private consumption meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to gdp would shrink in both years but given switzerland's large external surplus there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than gdp which if only in a small way would contribute to improving international balances the oecd said real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year with a 3 25 pct growth rate after several years of relative weakness it noted in 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2 25 pct growth rate but should still outstrip overall gdp it added the outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987 and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors it said as a consequence growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986 but the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry two major service sector earners of foreign exchange the long term appreciation of the swiss franc and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets could lead to a loss of international market share for both it said particularly for the banks recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the swiss financial system which has shown substantial flexibility in the past is adapting itself at the speed required to preserve its competitive position it said reuter 3

 private coffee exporters say colombia's more pragmatic coffee marketing policy will ensure that the country does not suffer excessively from current depressed prices and erratic market conditions gilberto arango president of the exporters' association said in an interview that colombia the world's second largest producer was in a position to withstand a prolonged absence of international coffee organization ico export quotas colombia is one of the countries that will benefit most from this situation he said recent ico talks in london failed to break a deadlock over re introduction of export quotas suspended in february 1986 and no date has been set for a new meeting on the issue arango said that government measures adopted here last week including a lower export registration price indicated a major change but also disclosed a welcome pragmatism this is the start of a new era in colombia because world market conditions are also new he said the government lowered local taxes for exporters and said the export registration price or reintegro will be changed more often in order to closely reflect market trends arango said an illustration of colombia's new attitude was the decision on friday to open export registrations for an unlimited amount but he added it did not imply the country would begin heavy selling of coffee our marketing policy is to sell without haste but consistently no targets for volume will be set we will react to market factors adequately and colombia has no intention of giving its coffee away colombia's past records should be the basis for upcoming exports he said we will certainly not export seven mln 60 kilo bags but neither are we going to sell like mad the trade knows full well what colombia's export potential is he said colombia with stockpiles standing at about 10 mln bags exported a record 11 5 mln bags in the 1985 86 coffee year which ended last september and 11 3 mln in calendar 1986 arango did not want to commit himself on export predictions but said that output for the 1986 87 coffee year would not exceed 10 5 mln bags compared with 12 mln forecast by the national coffee growers' federation and 12 5 mln by the u s department of agriculture a figure he said was ridiculous he said ageing plantations and rust in particular in the number one producing province of antioquia meant output was likely to fall but that nationwide estimates were rare and oscillated between 9 5 mln and 11 5 mln bags on the failure of the recent ico talks arango said colombia understandably felt frustrated at not having managed to force a compromise jorge cardenas manager of the national federation and head of his nation's delegation in london has blamed the intransigence of some big countries without naming them however arango like colombian finance minister cesar gaviria last week was more explicit and said the united states would undoubtedly be under great political pressure in coming weeks to revise its policy washington will have to take into account that for many countries and some of its allies for instance in central america a sharp fall in coffee export revenue would have far reaching political and economic consequences arango ruled out a fresh colombian initiative on export quotas saying producers had now to show a common resolve which could emerge from continuous contacts reuter 3

 opec conference president rilwanu lukman said the group was producing well below the 15 8 mln bpd ceiling it set in december partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed opec prices lukman during a brief visit to london on his way home from jamaica told reuters in a telephone interview that in february opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel we are determined to stand firm by the december accord he said i have spoken to every other opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work he said lukman gave no specific figures for february output he said the opec secretariat in vienna was finalizing these figures told of a reuters survey published today which estimated that opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd he said that could well be correct opec s news agency opecna today issued a statement saying group output was well below its ceiling in february but it gave no figures but one source close to opec indicated that february output may have been between 15 3 and 15 5 mln bpd the reuter survey estimated opec february output at around 16 mln bpd opec agreed in december to cut output by 7 25 pct to 15 8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting february 1 lukman said qatar nigeria saudi arabia and iran had all produced in february below their opec quotas iraq which said it would not honour its 1 466 mln bpd quota under the december pact had produced less than had been anticipated he said lukman said that some industry reports may be correct that in february nigeria propuced 75 100 000 bpd below its 1 238 mln bpd quota saudi arabia 500 000 bpd less than its 4 133 mln allocation and qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285 000 bpd quota he said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet north sea grades and the united states west texas intermediate wti crude however he said opec in december had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks we have to be patient for two or three weeks the market is now firming on actual fundamentals he said adding that he expected it to go up and up even beyond official prices after early april this is when traditionally there is more demand for gasoline rich crudes such as nigeria s the opec president said producers such as kuwait venezuela and indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products also some of venezuela s heavy grades were outside the opec pricing system he said lukman said that if refiner buyers now refusing to lift some opec oil at official prices instead used their own stocks and ran them down to dangerous levels they would eventually have to buy opec oil when they realise it is not a free for all in the market they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on he said lukman asked about industry reports that nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable flexible and under constant review not only when the market seemed weak he said that so far no meeting of the seven nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting now twice postponed was not a high priority for opec at the moment at this time we have to get our priorities right he said the most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working not dealing with a differential of cents between grades but if any opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system a meeting would be called he said reuter 3

 australia could lose valuable wheat markets through lack of availability if plantings for the coming 1987 88 season are significantly reduced australian wheat board awb chairman clinton condon said if predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove true australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its valuable markets he said in a statement condon did not say who had made the predictions but an awb spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that farmers hard hit by low prices and rising costs could cut back plantings sharply wheat sowing normally begins in may however condon said he did not believe plantings would be cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were facing enormous financial pressures he said the awb expects the area sown to be about 10 7 mln hectares down from 11 3 mln in 1986 87 when the crop was about 16 mln tonnes final crop estimates for 1986 87 and planting intentions for 1987 88 are not yet available if the awb is unable because of a short term cut in plantings to meet the needs of the markets it has developed with much time and effort it may have great difficulty selling wheat to those markets in the future condon said markets which rely on a steady supply of australian wheat understand a decrease in production due to drought but they will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to decrease production condon said if australia wants wheat to continue as a major export income earner governments and government authorities will need to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing viability of the wheat industry he added australia's leading wheat markets include china egypt iran iraq the soviet union and japan reuter 3

 australia is risking wheat export sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet buyer requirements the australian wheat board awb said many awb customers are becoming increasingly quality conscious demanding strict adherence to contractual quality specifications the board said in a submission to the royal commission into grain storage handling and transport many of the specifications are more specific than the current categories used in australia it said the commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but lower quality grades the awb submission said it stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every stage from receival to shipping better industrial relations at grain terminals more uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock control were vital to improved marketing it said the submission also said australia's federal system impeded the awb's role of coordinating and managing the marketing of wheat the awb called for an end to physical and legislative constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient transport of grains to other states for shipment it is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode to the nearest efficient port irrespective of the state in which the wheat is grown or stored it said for example wheat grown in northern new south wales nsw might move more efficiently to brisbane in queensland than to sydney or newcastle in new south wales it said similarly southern nsw wheat might better be shipped to portland or geelong in victoria legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over grain shipments was one notable impediment it said the awb said the current approach of state based bulk handling authorities is not essential although it said it favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current level of control of storage and transport as long as quality was maintained an appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26 500 and 34 700 u s dlrs to load a 50 000 tonne vessel at various australian ports compared with 21 200 dlrs at houston and 16 300 at port cartier quebec for a 60 000 tonner reuter 3

 one or two large west german banks effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from their overnight deposits money dealers said as a result call money soared in active trading to around the lombard rate of five pct from 3 70 80 pct yesterday as banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily 51 billion marks in interest free minimum reserve assets at the central bank over the first 29 days of the month though this was above the march requirement of 50 7 billion actual holdings at the weekend were 44 2 billion to meet the daily average dealers said banks must raise holdings by two billion marks to 46 3 billion today and tomorrow but liquidity was tight in early business because banks excessively took up the bundesbank's offer for sale of treasury bills on friday this provides a rate of 3 50 pct for three day deposits and is an effective floor to the market though some liquidity from bills bought on thursday flowed back into the market today the bulk would not return until tomorrow the start of the new month dealers said dealers said the large banks which they did not name commanded short term money requirements of as much as five billion marks or so with a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the month the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills draining liquidity for three days when other banks sought funds rates rose and large banks were able to place excess funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return one senior dealer said the bundesbank with advanced knowledge of the market's needs should have curtailed its sales of treasury bills on friday though dealers only late in the day learn of the total minimum reserve holdings of the previous day the bundesbank has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate the strength of demand for funds the following day he said bundesbank dealers could easily have said we are not selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this amount he said if the bundesbank wants to finely steer the market then they should avoid such excesses tomorrow it will be different call money will fall back to 4 0 pct or so but the bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in rates given the delicate state of currency markets international central banks have been at pains to prevent a dollar fall against major currencies including the mark dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer undertone contributing to downward pressure on the dollar the whole tender policy is to have a call money of between three and four pct in that case the excesses as we have today cannot be very popular the senior dealer said dealers said the large banks probably achieved average rates of return on their excess funds of between 3 75 pct or four pct this is a higher return than they would have earned without the excessive draining through the treasury bill mechanism because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations between germany's major employers and the unions the bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to monetary policy at its council meeting on thursday they said bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1 5 billion marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business reuter 3

 saudi arabia has speeded up reform of its financial system with a package of measures designed to boost the economy and open up the kingdom to the lucrative world of investment banking bankers in saudi arabia detect a fundamental shift in policy stemming from a need to tackle the underlying contradiction between an islamic legal framework and western banking system one senior banker in jeddah said there is a new wind blowing saudi arabia is moving on many fronts in a manner that is extraordinarily aggressive the speed of reform begun last year but now gathering pace has surprised bankers who have had to contend with a financial system that restricted internationalisation of the riyal and a religious court system that made debt collecting difficult saudi banks once the most profitable in the world have generally reported falling profits for 1986 the fourth successive year of decline as loan loss provisions ate into already dwindling earnings bankers say the saudi finance ministry and saudi arabian monetary agency sama seem to have developed a new strategy although it remains to be seen how it will be implemented reform started in 1986 with measures to boost previously dormant stock trading but took off in earnest this year from january 1 sama liberalised the money market giving banks greater access to liquidity aid via repurchase agreements from march 22 the finance ministry abolished withholding tax on funds borrowed by saudi banks abroad from the same date banks were notified of a new committee to be set up under the auspices of sama to hear bank disputes with creditors over non payment of loans also from the same date banks were allowed to use mortgages as collateral for lending banned since 1981 within a few weeks the kingdom's first stock market trading floor is expected to be opened housed in central riyadh in the building of the saudi industrial development fund the floor will initially be used to trade shares on an auction system staff from each of the 11 commercial banks have been trained ahead of the launch and a new computer network has been set up one banker said the abolition of withholding tax will give banks the opportunity to participate in new instruments such as interest rate or currency swaps at last sama and the finance ministry are opening up markets for investment banking bankers say saudi authorities appear to have been shocked into reform by pressure from banks and alarm at bank reluctance to extend further loans to the private sector banks have lobbied hard for change arguing that the religious or sharia legal framework was inconsistent with the kingdom's western banking system and made it nigh impossible for them to collect interest on bad loans through the courts as a result many banks had virtually stopped new lending but found themselves cut off from world investment banking by a series of restrictions withholding tax made it punitively expensive to take part in interest rate or currency swaps the private sector's frustration at the virtual standstill in bank lending overflowed at a businessmen's conference in the mountain resort in abha last month and some powerful merchant families also called for change bankers said banks lobbied hard and had the ultimate weapon to force change they stopped lending another banker said that was stifling growth of the economy it is still unclear whether the new committee that will be set up to hear bank disputes with creditors will prove any more efficient than another non sharia system already in force the committees for the settlement of commercial disputes cscds some bankers believe the new committee yet to be formed will simply delay pending cases and force banks into a series of private deals with creditors nor is it clear what stance the new committee will take on interest payments generally not recognised under islamic law but other bankers say the move is clear recognition by sama and the finance ministry that sharia courts and the cscds were not the correct bodies for hearing bank disputes other reforms have been taken or are in the pipeline finance minister mohammed ali abal khail said in march that a new body would examine late government payments to contractors in addition further moves are under way to align business life to the gregorian calendar year with companies being urged to adopt it as their financial year a black list of borrowers started more than two years ago by banks has recently been effectively sanctioned by sama bankers say banks are now not permitted to lend or engage in securities transactions with any party on the list reuter 3

 a spokesman for the european community commission defended the controversial plan for a levy on oils and fats saying that consumers would have to help alleviate the surplus problem by paying the proposed tax norbert tanghe head of division of the commission's directorate general for agriculture told the 8th antwerp oils and fats contact days the commission firmly believes that the sacrifices which would be undergone by community producers in the oils and fats sector would justify asking consumers to make an appropriate contribution to solving the serious problem within that sector by paying a levy the proposed tax is necessary because the level of budgetary costs resulting from olive oil and oilseeds production has become unacceptable tanghe said recent estimates put these costs at 4 0 billion european currency units and by 1990 they would rise by another 2 0 billion ecus he said in 1990 the community's standstill agreements with spain and portugal end and the ec would then feel the full impact of its enlargement the commission has proposed several cost and production cutting measures which include the introduction of a maximum guaranteed quantity system he added under the commission's system for stabilising consumer prices in the oils and fats sector a reference price of 700 ecus per tonne for refined soy oil would be introduced tanghe said consumer prices could be raised or lowered by a regulatory amount when market prices are below or above this level he said the revenue generated by charging a regulatory amount would be used to finance the common agricultural policy's oils and fats regime the commission believes that hostile reactions to the proposed tax have for the most part been based on incomplete or an insufficiently thorough analysis of the proposal he said tanghe said the proposed system conforms with general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt rules it would not be discriminatory because it would be applied to domestic and imported products and past experience showed it would not cause any decline in consumption of oils and fats ec produced oilseeds would not benefit more than they do under present aid arrangements he said the competitiveness between different oils whether ec produced or imported would remain unchanged and quantities imported from third countries would not be affected by the tax tanghe said the proposed system would not alter the ec nations' requirements as far as imports are concerned since the overall effect would stabilise community production levels without affecting demand he said it is one of the proposal's objectives to maintain current import levels he said imports of soybeans would be unaffected because they are imported primarily to satisfy the ec's cakes and meals requirements which are not covered by the stabilising system furthermore more than half the oil produced from imported beans is re exported to third countries tanghe added reuter 3

 canada's decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the u s was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of canadian self confidence a public policy study group said it suggests the canada of the immediate post war period when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world the washington based atlantic council said u s and canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually the council's study said the trade talks with a deadline of october for an agreement are the biggest issue in u s canadian relations the study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties the council said in the past most canadians have shied away from the notion of a free trade arrangement fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population but at the same time it added canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world the council said that in the talks canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of u s duties against allegedly subsidized exports a recent example was the 15 per cent duty the u s imposed on canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized the council said the chief u s concerns included ending curbs against u s banking insurance telecommunications and the so called cultural industries publishing broadcasting and films it said other major u s canadian issues were defense cooperation acid rain and the u s rejection of a canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the northwest passage reuter 3

 efforts by governments to control wheat surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial success the international wheat council iwc says in its latest monthly report faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing both price and areas as employed in the united states the iwc says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat exporters argentina australia canada the ec and the u s in some countries for example australia and argentina which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export income there may be problems in reducing production a policy of cutting wheat production could lead to unemployment with job prospects outside agriculture limited alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems the iwc outlines three courses of action open to governments in wheat exporting countries they could continue to support prices in the hope that when the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated alternatively support could be limited to wheat which could be easily sold without needing to be stored for a long period this option may prove to be the most politically unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning wheat production the report said the third option would be for governments to distinguish between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture possibly varying support prices according to farm size or overall production the iwc review covers support prices in the major exporting countries since 1982 at some time during that period all the producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses these changes did not always result in lower export subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more than offset lower prices in the domestic currency for example between 1985 86 and 1986 87 the ec intervention price for bread wheat fell from 209 30 to 179 44 european currency units ecus it dollar terms the currency in which most export transactions are denominated the intervention price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168 the high cost of supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers and some governments are now searching for ways to cut expenditure the report says the proportion of world wheat output produced by the five major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987 this was partly due to increased production in china and india the period saw an upward trend in yields although this was countered in the argentina the u s and australia by lower acreages in argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to other enterprises particularly livestock while lower u s acreages are attributed to official incentives reuter 3

 brazil is not happy with the existing structure of the 14 bank advisory committee which coordinates its commercial bank debt finance minister dilson funaro said u s banks have 50 pct representation on the committee while holding only 35 pct of brazil's debt to banks he said adding this is not fair with the european and japanese banks the committee had played a useful role in 1982 and 1983 however noting the often different reactions of u s japanese and european banks funaro told journalists that brazil might adopt an approach involving separate discussions with the regions since debtor nations' problems were normally treated on a case by case basis perhaps the same principle should apply to creditors central bank president francisco gros said brazil on february 20 suspended indefinitely interest payments on 68 billion dlrs owed to commercial banks followed last week by a freeze on bank and trade credit lines deposited by foreign banks and institutions worth some 15 billion dlrs funaro and gros spent two days at the end of last week in washington talking to government officials and international agencies and will this week visit britain france west germany switzerland and italy for discussions with governments funaro and gros are today meeting british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson foreign secretary geoffrey howe and governor of the bank of england robin leigh pemberton bankers have estimated that brazil owes u k banks around 8 5 billion dlrs in long and medium term loans giving the u k the third largest exposure after the u s and japan the crisis began when brazil's trade surplus its chief means of servicing its foreign debt started to decline sharply and the problem was compounded by a renewed surge in the country's 127 ate of inflation reserves were reported to have dropped below four billion dlrs funaro envisaged that any eventual solution to problems with brazil's 108 billion dlr foreign debt would involve only partial servicing of the debt what we propose is to arrive at a mechanism of refinance for part of the service because we cannot service all that he said i really think we have to change the old rules asked why brazil was first approaching governments rather than the commercial banks themselves in its search for a solution to the crisis funaro said we must first talk to the governments and then we can talk to the banks because the banks have some limits it is a political discussion from our point of view he said funaro said he hoped next week to travel to talk to japanese and canadian government officials he would then talk to the commercial banks if i've got some solution from the governments i can't take the burden only to the banks he was not sure how long it would take to reach a solution 127 in discussions with governments brazil would review the mechanisms whereby finance was made available to nations in need finance from official lending agencies had been virtually closed since 1982 you must open these mechanisms he said he said that while the u s officials had been disturbed by brazil's suspension of interest payments they understood brazil had no other choice as it had to protect its reserves also the financing mechanisms had to be discussed because we can't stay as we were the last few years i'm trying to put the problem on the table all of us would like to have a kind of equilibrium he said although brazil has rejected a substantive role for the international monetary fund imf in managing its economy funaro paid a call in washington to imf managing director michel camdessus and to world bank president barber conable funaro noted that inflation in february had started to decline again and he expected brazil to achieve a minimum eight billion dlr trade surplus in 1987 banking sources noted that brazil's monthly surplus had declined to some 150 mln dlrs in the final three months of last year against a monthly one billion in the first nine months brazil had the third largest trade surplus in the world funaro said although its share of international trade was only one pct the solution is linked with growth not recession he said noting an imf program would involve promoting exports and inducing an internal recession in order to service debt banking sources said brazil's debts to foreign governments as opposed to commercial banks now benefit from a sounder structure following last month's rescheduling by the paris club of creditor nations of 4 12 billion dlrs of official debt reuter 3
 latin american sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production official and trade sources said although prices have risen to around eight from five u s cents per lb in the past six months they are still below the region's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost the recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert manuel rico a consultant with the group of latin american and caribbean sugar exporting countries geplacea told reuters however rico said it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable he said officials in mexico guatemala and ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production but industry leaders in panama and costa rica said there was still a long way to go the prices are ridiculous said julian mateo vice president of costa rica's sugar cane industrial agricultural league at current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output given the instability of world markets an official at colombia's national association of sugar cane growers said they had no plans to raise export targets the market is very unstable what is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything in 1985 the latest year for which full figures are available central and south american nations produced 28 mln tonnes raw value of sugar of which 12 3 mln were exported a year earlier they had produced and exported about 800 000 more according to the london based international sugar organization years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover miguel guerrero director of the dominican republic's national sugar institute said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply output had slumped to under 450 000 tonnes a year from 900 000 in the late 1970s obsolete refineries poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output he added plans of nearby cuba the world's largest cane sugar exporter to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious trade sources said output is running well below the record 8 6 mln produced in 1970 cuba suffers from run down plantations harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices since much of its output is sold to eastern bloc countries under special deals last year bad weather added to its troubles and output fell to 7 2 mln tonnes from 8 2 mln in 1985 the low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover u s and in the case of some caribbean countries european community ec import quotas for which they receive prices well above free market levels progressive reductions in the u s quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market peru for example shipped 96 000 tonnes to the u s in both 1983 and 1984 this fell to 76 000 in 1986 and this year its quota is only 37 000 a national cooperative official said that as long as world market levels continue at around half of peru's production cost the future of the industry is uncertain at a meeting of geplacea in brazil last october officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which according to the group's executive secretary eduardo latorre grows like a weed throughout the region brazil the largest cane producer with output of around 240 mln tonnes uses over half to produce alcohol fuel cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency the difference in the price the state run sugar and alcohol institute iaa pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year coupled with a drought reduced cane crop has meant brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in 1987 trade sources said negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far the main sticking point being how brazil should compensate buyers for non delivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year with the institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles however the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps sources within latin america and the caribbean hold little hope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability unless the u s and ec change their policies the agricultural policies of the european community and of the united states have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries brazil's trade and industry minister jose hugo castelo branco told the october geplacea meeting the ec has come under prolonged attack from geplacea for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets geplacea officials say this is the main cause of low prices geplacea sees a new international sugar agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the region's industry out of steady decline such an agreement would have to have both u s and ec backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact they have to realise that the more our economies suffer the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the region's 360 billion dollar foreign debt geplacea's latorre said reuter 3

 in a bid to hasten japan's promise to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign trade top u s officials appear once again to have signaled their tolerance of a lower dollar treasury secretary james baker and one of his top aides assistant secretary david mulford said last week there was no target for the dollar a statement that sent the yen soaring against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention that was no slip of the tongue said one western monetary official who asked not to be identified for now the strategy appears to be working japanese officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic demand will be ready in early april until last week there were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon the reagan administration facing an uproar in congress over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169 8 billion dlr trade deficit is learning now that to extract results from japan dramatic action is required last week the white house imposed unprecedented tariffs on certain japanese electronic goods after tokyo failed to adhere to a semi conductor pricing accord between the two countries the shift in u s strategy in part designed to appease mounting congressional anger over japanese policies comes just two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review the paris agreement to stabilize currencies and news that japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the need for urgent action in the view of u s officials nonetheless u s officials see signs of improvement in the deficit i'd be stunned if we were not going to derive some benefits from the lower dollar soon said one in paris leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting underlying economic fundamentals or economic reality the agreement envisages those fundamentals to include japan and west germany stimulating their economies and the united states cutting its budget deficit the three nations joined by france britain and canada agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade imbalances but analysts say markets have signalled the underlying fundamentals imply a lower dollar rather than a stable one markets in effect are less confident than governments that these measures including u s budget deficit cuts agreed by congress and the white house will be carried out nonetheless the dollar's sharp fall has not undermined cooperation a u s economic policymaker said the accord was on track and tokyo and bonn seem to want more stimulative measures which is what the paris accord calls for international monetary sources said exchange market developments generally have not unsettled policymakers although japan is an obvious exception everybody feels it can still be managed one source said of market developments but last week the bank of japan spent an estimated five billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen and other central banks about one billion dlrs another monetary source said japan was upset with america's half hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar flouting the paris accord outright the source close to the top levels of japanese economic policymaking said japan's understanding of the accord was that the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar the level it stood at when the accord was struck the source said tokyo was extremely worried by washington's use of the exchange rate to change japanese policies it was a pointed reminder to japan to do something about the trade issues the source said of the dollar's fall against the yen by departing last sunday from the language of the paris accord that nations agreed to foster currency stability around current levels baker triggered a run on the dollar later in the week mulford too said there was no target for the dollar and called on japan and west germany to live up to their international responsibilities and stimulate growth but u s officials said recent market developments will not unravel the spirit of the paris agreement there's a realisation now that you cannot leave things alone everyone agrees that the external trade imbalances ought to be adjusted one official said while no one is going to cede national sovereignty we certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co operation another u s official said the officials said the meeting here where the six will be joined by italy will be a status report japan will have to explain what the state of their program is and germany will report on its plans maybe there's a need to move faster one source said mulford told congress last week the paris accord called in effect for currency stability for several months this would buy time for japan and west germany to speed up their economic growth and help bring down the u s trade deficit his comments appeared to serve notice on other major nations that washington cannot wait too long for action to reduce the gap between the japanese and german trade surpluses and the u s trade deficit reuter 3

 higher world oil prices coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity could lift saudi arabia's economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits bankers and diplomats said the months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about 20 billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct the first rise since 1982 but the economists said this will be possible only if the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec succeeds in defending world oil prices and if saudi arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long saudi arabia is now keeping production down to defend opec's newly established 18 dlr a barrel benchmark price oil minister hisham nazer told reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day bpd well down on saudi arabia's opec quota of 4 13 mln set for the first half of 1987 king fahd has stamped his personal authority on opec's new found determination to defend prices in a move western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom's need to secure a stable source of income for its economy saudi arabia still the world's largest oil exporter is a hugely wealthy country but the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll economists estimate gross domestic product fell 10 pct last year and 8 6 pct in 1985 oil revenue last year when prices briefly dipped below 10 dlrs per barrel probably totalled no more than 17 5 billion dlrs compared to a peak 101 8 billion in 1981 austerity is still the watchword but saudi arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession the saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects a diplomat said in the short term the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves still put at around 100 billion dlrs but such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term it also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to tough it out on the oil front even if that means a short term depletion of reserves the 1987 budget deficit is targetted at a huge 52 7 billion riyals or 31 pct of total outlay the budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out commerce minister suleiman abdulaziz al salim told saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year it therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than 50 billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy he said reserves were built up during the late 1970's and early 1980's when saudi arabia's breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary the shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the kingdom's private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom modern techniques of cost control have been introduced markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back the expatriate workforce has fallen sharply the number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but saudi banks hit hard by non performing loans to the corporate sector have become highly selective in extending new credit government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation's industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit as saudi arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad reuter 3

 energy secretary john herrington has proposed several ways to boost u s oil production but he said all would cost the treasury money and will come under close white house scrutiny before action is taken one measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27 5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year the white house reacting said it did not favor amending the tax code but would look at the proposal herrington's proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department's report on energy and the national security the report said u s oil imports rapidly rising could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security he has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria increase production not cause economic dislocation and be low cost to the taxpayer herrington said an import fee would meet the first test spurring production but fail the second and third he said it would raise production and return 120 000 oil workers to their jobs but at the same time it lifted oil prices the higher prices would cost 400 000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs a tax on gasoline he said would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production in any case u s officials say president reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax options which meet herrington's criteria include loan price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices it was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs a five pct tax credit for exploration and development it would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325 000 barrels a day at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year a five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures it would increase production by 80 000 barrels a day at a cost of 65 mln dlrs lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration a drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5 760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144 000 dlrs herrington also pressed anew for existing administration proposals to deregulate natural gas which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300 000 barrels daily he also called again for congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil and the arctic national wildlife refuge which may hold nine billion barrels herrington said he understood the reagan's reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals but added he hoped his department's energy security study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry another move herrington said he will press anew even though it had been rejected earlier by the white house is to raise the fill rate for the strategic petroleum reserve to 100 000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35 000 this he said would further bolster national security in case of an oil supply disruption reuter 3

 the belgian government which introduced large scale public spending reductions last year has been told by an international monetary fund team there is scope for further cuts in 1988 the suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions of the annual imf consultations with belgium on its economic policy a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet the imf team also urges belgium to adopt a firm interest rate policy with a particular emphasis on long term rates the team's report to the government praises last year's spending cuts which are due to reduce 1987 government spending by 195 billion francs and says 1986 saw the belgian economy perform better on a broader basis than at any time so far in the 1980s however it adds that with lower inflation stabilisation of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much lower budget deficit than the seven pct of gnp target the government has set itself for 1989 the government's net financing requirement was 11 0 pct of gnp in 1986 the report says the most that can be afforded over the next few years is a zero growth of real non interest expenditure of general government it says there is a need for a revision of the belgian tax system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the debt to gnp ratio before this is possible because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure growth and of likely growing impatience for tax reductions we feel that your position would be stronger if you could decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988 the report adds the imf urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the government's determination to keep its currency strong and to curb inflation it says firmer long term rates would slow private net long term capital outflows which increased strongly in 1986 it also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the subscriptions by non residents of government bond issues in belgian francs reuter 3
 saudi arabia is likely to remain the key supplier of liquefied petroleum gas lpg to japan for at least the next five years oil industry sources said japan while diversifying its supply sources of propane and butane for stable supplies will continue to bank on saudi arabian lpg the sources said they said saudi's supply capabilities of lpg an associate of crude oil is guaranteed by its crude output capacity saudi is a reliable supplier in that sense said one trader japan imports about 50 pct of its lpg from saudi arabia no single nation could substitute for saudi arabia as an lpg supply source to japan the sources said saudi arabia has committed itself to japanese lpg buyers which has quelled fears that lpg supplies from the mideast gulf could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities in that area said another trader saudi arabia cut lpg shipments to japan and elsewhere by 20 pct in september after a fire put a major gas plant at al juaimah out of operation october shipments were back to contractual volumes as saudi was able to boost exports from other ports attacks on gulf shipping by iran and iraq centered on crude rather than products carriers which has lulled fears of lpg supply disruptions traders said they said an iranian blockade of the strait of hormuz was unlikely because it would block iran's oil shipments industry sources said japan's lpg imports will not greatly rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a moderate 2 1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991 japanese term buyers of saudi lpg are expected to lift slightly lower volumes from january 1987 when imports from indonesia are slated to increase the sources said the customers are unlikely to slash saudi term purchases in large scale when japan increases annual imports of indonesian lpg to 1 95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319 000 tonnes in the year ended march 1987 the sources said but when demand is sluggish in summer they will phase down term purchases of saudi lpg and secure lower priced cargoes on the spot market they said japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of lpg a year of which 5 3 mln tonnes are supplied by saudi arabia 3 3 mln under term contracts and two mln through spot purchases some 80 pct of japan's lpg imports are from the middle east saudi arabia's state owned oil company petromin has made some concessions on term prices to japanese customers in the recent round of contract renewal talks and it is likely the japanese will accept the offer the sources said the japanese term customers however have so far been unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice japanese buyers pay saudi arabia a price notified by petromin each month most recently the fob price was set at 87 pct of the 17 52 dlrs per barrel government selling price gsp of arabian light buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of arabian light's gsp petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the 95 pct for contracts with japanese customers from next january the trade sources said petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to seller buyer agreement under the present contract petromin can automatically cut supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume if you want to import lpg from saudi arabia on a profitable basis you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct said an official at a major importer freight costs are higher for cargoes coming from the gulf than southeast asia due to a longer haul and war risk insurance payments japanese customers will visit saudi arabia this month to finalise their separate contract talks now focusing on contractual period and volume which could be very similar to current levels the sources said when we talk business we would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of high dependence on a single supplier said one reuter 3

 the japanese economy will remain sluggish in the months ahead after turning in its worst performance for 12 years in 1986 private economists said consumer spending a main driving force of domestic demand was likely to remain lacklustre although brisk housing and business investment would help sustain the economy this year the economists said they said they were shocked by an economic planning agency report today that private spending fell 0 7 pct in the oct dec quarter for the first time in 12 years the report said japan's gross national product rose a real 0 8 pct in oct dec after a revised 0 7 pct increase in the previous quarter it said gnp growth for 1986 was a real 2 5 pct down from 4 7 pct in 1985 agency officials said this was the worst performance since 1974 when gnp contracted 1 4 pct in the wake of the first oil crisis they expressed concern about the 0 7 pct decline in consumer spending in the final quarter of 1986 but said it was only temporary as exceptionally warm winter weather had depressed retail sales but most private economists disagreed and said consumers were likely to remain pessimistic in coming months as they saw their real income level off sure consumers may have spent less on winter clothes or heating apparatus because of the warm winter this year but they have done so because they have become even more uneasy about their future pay rises said shoji saito general manager of mitsui bank's economic research division he said the outlook for pay increases was gloomy because of falling employment in many industries particularly those hit hard by the yen's rise masao suzaki senior economist at the bank of tokyo said weakened consumer confidence was the most worrying factor without brisk consumer spending japan can hardly achieve domestically generated economic growth as the government has put a lid on fiscal measures he said other economists said the 0 8 pct growth registered in oct dec may have been inflated by special factors including exceptionally heavy spending in the public sector johsen takahashi chief economist at mitsubishi research institute said the 14 4 pct increase in public sector spending in oct dec resulted from an issue of gold coins this is just a one shot spending and we can't expect that high level of public sector consumption in the following quarter takahashi said agency officials said public spending would have risen 1 1 pct in oct dec without the issue which marked 60 years of emperor hirohito's reign takahashi said the economy might contract in the current quarter given the lack of additional significant government spending and sluggish consumer spending saito said the most effective government action would be income tax cuts and the postponement beyond next january of a proposed controversial sales tax reuter 3

 the world bank's policies prevent it from lending money for the transfer of land from landowners to the landless but it can help finance development of the philippines' proposed land reform program a bank official said the world bank by its established policies cannot use its resources to finance the transfer of assets from one group to another our mandate is to finance investment related activities rolando arrivillaga the bank's resident representative in the philippines told reuters in an interview arrivillaga said he wanted to clarify part of a report by a world bank mission that came in march to review the land reform program and which said the bank would not be able to finance compensation payments for the transfer of land he said the philippine government had never asked the bank to finance land transfers and the bank's position should not be taken to mean that it ruled out any lending for the program clearly in the case of land reform the question of land transfer by definition is transferring assets from the landed to the landless arrivillaga said however the bank as an institution can finance the development aspects of the program we will deal with the part of the program that deals with how to put the land to effective use once it has been transferred and how to make the on farm investments that are needed to attain the goal of improving the income level of the beneficiaries arrivillaga said i wouldn't be surprised if other multilateral institutions are faced with similar constraints he said president corazon aquino's spokesman said last week that she was committed to launching the program which limits land holdings to seven hectares by using her sweeping powers of rule by decree before a new congress convenes in july presidential spokesman teodoro benigno said the land reform program estimated to cost about 44 billion pesos would be implemented in four phases and benefit 2 64 mln farmers benigno said the first two phases would complete the transfer of rice and corn lands and abandoned farmland as well as the transfer of land sequestered expropriated or foreclosed by the government and would cover 1 15 mln hectares but aquino would not decree the redistribution of large sugar banana and coconut plantations leaving it to the congress to work out the details benigno said arrivillaga said bilateral aid donors who form part of a consultative group led by the world bank might be prepared to finance the land transfers i don't think there are fast and easy rules as to how international sources of finance would behave in a situation like this because land reform by its very nature requires rich financing to be able to carry out the reform in a way equitable to both the landowner and the beneficiary he said arrivillaga said the first priority for the government would be to tap domestic sources of financing for the land transfer but external assistance could be brought in if there were gaps in such a fundamental reform the test of the willingness of the government is how it confronts the domestic resource requirement arrivillaga said multilateral agencies by their very nature are lenders of last resort it means they have to be convinced that the government prioritises the program he said the world bank had financed developmental costs under an earlier land reform program launched by former president ferdinand marcos in 1972 and such aid had been channelled through the land bank of the philippines lbp the lbp is the main implementing agency under aquino's program if asked to do so again and the program is designed to improve the standard of living of the poor then we would certainly be prepared to consider lending arrivillaga said he said the tendency in such programs was to exaggerate the costs by presenting ten year perspectives in a one year context arrivillaga said the government could solve most of its financing problems by devising effective instruments to compensate landowners finance secretary jaime ongpin has said landowners are likely to be paid 10 pct in cash and the rest in 10 year bonds with 10 pct of their face value redeemable each year arrivillaga said any instruments used to compensate landowners had to be freely tradable at near face value and added the challenge is to devise a system of deferred payments that is as good as cash he said the international financing community was watching the philippine experiment with great interest they are going to be an interesting model for many other countries because they opened a dialogue on the reforms to every sector of the population and even international institutions he said i think they'll be on a very solid base when they make the decision to launch the reforms reuter 3

 the government's over reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting australia's economic performance australian petroleum exploration association apea chairman dennis benbow said over one third of australia's indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices he told the apea annual conference here this dependence on oil generated revenue distorts the country's economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs he said australia's medium term liquid fuel self sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat yet the government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry benbow said domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280 000 barrels per day bpd in fiscal 1992 93 from 546 000 bpd in 1985 86 reflecting mainly the decline of the bass strait fields he said bass strait reserves are now two thirds depleted with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted he said by 1992 93 bass strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985 86 level assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead benbow said government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40 000 to 130 000 bpd he said australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680 000 bpd in 1992 93 from 565 000 in 1985 86 implying a crude oil gap of between 270 000 and 360 000 bpd in five years time he said at present world oil prices and the current value of the australian dollar annual oil imports in 1992 93 would cost between 3 2 billion and 3 6 billion dlrs benbow said despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's the addition to reserves has been inadequate he said for example the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980 84 represent about two years' consumption he said he called on the government to review its tax policies to restore incentive to exploration reuter 3

 usx corp chairman david roderick called for a lower value for the u s dollar against other currencies to help speed a correction in the u s trade deficit which last year reached 170 billion dlrs in remarks prepared for a speech before the economic club of detroit roderick said there should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies as well as the currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus with us must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery roderick said the u s should be understanding of the economic pain our trading partners experience as a result of a falling dollar but he added as painful as the correction may be to our trading partners it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable lengthy and steep world recession roderick said between february 1985 and december 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations at the end of 1986 he said the value of foreign assets in the u s exceeded the value of u s assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs compared to five years ago when the u s had a surplus in assets of 141 billion a company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to usx the primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985 although other factors were involved roderick said but it is wrong he said to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental deterioration of u s productivity or of american product quality these areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem roderick said he urged american manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets in the speech the usx chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators among his proposals which he presented to the senate banking committee in testimony last week were a requirement that raiders give 24 hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in a company roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before a tender is made further raiders should be required to make an all cash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company's stock he said and payment of greenmail or a preferential price by a target company to buy back a raider's stake should be prohibited under the revised laws roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage fair price to all takeovers reuter 3

 opec has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15 8 mln barrels per day bpd to defend prices its president rilwanu lukman said he told a news conference here after due consultation with my colleagues in opec i hereby wish to emphasize that nigeria and all member countries of opec remain determined to uphold the december agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices lukman added no extraordinary opec conference was planned we are in a position to re confirm that despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary opec member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of february lukman who is nigerian oil minister said lukman put the overall opec output shortfall in february at 900 000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last december in geneva the december agreement set an overall output ceiling for opec of 15 8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from february 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs oil prices rallied immediately after the geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that opec was producing more than the agreed level the idea was to suggest that opec's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of opec oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs lukman said he said the 900 000 bpd shortfall last february was based on the verified figure for 10 out of opec's 13 members adding that nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100 000 bpd iraq disassociated itself from the december agreement while the production figures of ecuador and the united arab emirates needed to be verified lukman said if that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed we are ready opec is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs the group's president said he said the opec price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to april had been put off indefinitely furthermore no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in december are being adhered to he said asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various opec crudes fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark lukman replied we consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials lukman said opec was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude we don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year lukman said the opec president praised non opec oil producers which he said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise prices but he criticised britain for maintaining its long held view not to do anything to help the market we are quite confident however that in the long term with two thirds of the world's reserves in opec hands the future is ours we will use that advantage responsibly he said lukman described the disruption in ecuador's output following an earthquake as tragic but refused to say if the south american country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster reuter 3

 the economy faces lackluster growth and the risk of recession this year if the recent improvement in u s exports should falter economists say growth will slow sharply in the next months due to weakness in the key housing and auto sectors and could be further hampered unless consumer spending picks up they say these factors raise the question is there enough strength to keep the economy from tipping into a recession said lyle gramley chief economist of the mortgage bankers association and a former federal reserve board official the commerce department said this week that the economy grew by a robust 4 8 pct annual rate in the first quarter but a u s monetary official called it a weak report housing starts fell 2 7 pct in may and consumer spending rose a weak 0 1 per cent our two largest visible industries autos and housing are faltering but exports are picking up some of the slack martin mauro senior economist for merrill lynch economics told reuters gramley said he is worried that consumer spending may slow because inflation is rising faster than real wages to offset this u s exports must continue to rise returning enough jobs to the manufacturing sector to boost personal income and consumption he says i expect to see enough improvement in real net exports to keep a recession from happening but it is a close call gramley said federal reserve board governor martha seger told reporters that the apparent strength in the 4 8 pct growth figure was the result of a temporary buildup in inventories that will not last and said the recovery was showing anemia seger said that with the recovery stumbling along the pace of the economy and the lack of robustness must be factored into monetary policy possibly a signal that the fed will be accommodative most economists predict growth slower than the 3 pct forecast by the reagan administration for 1987 and warn that if the dollar drops suddenly higher inflation will result and add to the risk of a recession mauro said a 0 5 pct rise in industrial production in may came despite cutbacks in output in the auto industry where an inventory overhang still exists he says the boost in production came from smaller industries like paper chemicals and lumber which have improved sales overseas due to the drop in the dollar they are not going to be enough for any kind of surge in economic activity but i think they will keep us out of a recession mauro said in a speech to financial planners this week beryl sprinkel the chief white house economic adviser predicted the trade deficit will continue to improve prospects for continued economic growth through 1987 and into 1988 are still quite favorable he said but private economists raise concerns about a resurgence in inflation allen sinai chief economist at shearson lehman brothers inc told congress this week that inflation would rise to 4 5 to five pct this year and stay at that level through 1989 after a 1 1 pct increase in 1986 the rise is coming from a sharply lower dollar higher oil and energy prices and rising prices for services he said the lesson of history is that once the inflation genie gets out of the bottle it continues to persist he said adding he would like the fed to tighten credit a major factor affecting inflation is the value of the dollar which should continue to fall and feed inflation says a prominent international banker rainer gut chairman of credit suisse told the national press club that the dollar's downward trend against the yen and the mark will continue for years because the united states is the world's largest debtor nation the swiss banker said the economic indicators point to a further slackening of activity and called naive the belief that the five year boom on world equity markets will go on forever it is very difficult to be optimistic gut said reuter 3

 the south african reserve bank confirming previous estimates said real gross domestic product in the 1986 fourth quarter grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4 7 pct versus 4 6 pct in the third quarter and 1 3 pct in the 1985 final quarter the bank in its latest quarterly review said the nominal growth rate for the year did not quite reach one pct after a 1 5 pct contraction in 1985 but it said when the strengthening of the terms of trade is taken into account the real gnp in 1986 advanced by 1 5 pct compared with a decrease of 0 5 pct in 1985 gdp is the total value of goods and services produced by an economy but omits income from abroad gnp includes such payments or outflows the bank also said there were indications the country's economic recovery was becoming more broadly based with the exception of commerce all major sectors of the economy contributed to the fourth quarter rise in domestic production the bank said major increases in foreign reserves were recorded in january february and the first half of march 1987 reserves rose by 1 70 billion rand during january and february total reserves in 1986 declined by 189 mln rand to 5 70 billion rand and were equivalent to about 14 5 pct of the total annual value of import payments the current account surplus amounted to 7 20 billion rand in 1986 versus 5 90 mln the previous year the bank said continuing strength of the current account has allowed foreign reserves to be rebuilt to more comfortable levels this has strengthened the authorities' hands in lending support to the exchange rate of the rand if such action were to be called for the bank said reuter 3

 financial analysts see little chance that u s interest rate futures will break out of their narrow ranges and low volatility during the remainder of the week we got a little volatility wednesday said staley commodities international analyst jerome lacey but for the moment we're still in a trading range even unexpected developments concerning the growth of the u s economy may not be enough to spur the market out of its sluggish state the analysts said it the bond market has not yet demonstrated that it can break out of its very low volatility said carroll mcentee and mcginley analyst denis karnosky it needs something but it's not going to be news about the economy he said karnosky said that the bond market will possibly break out of the doldrums if participants perceive that the dollar has stabilized and the federal reserve has more room to conduct monetary policy but even wednesday when fed funds were below six pct the dollar strong and oil on the soft side bond futures attracted eager sellers when contracts approached recent highs he said in addition to a changing perception about the dollar and monetary policy golden gate futures president norman quinn said the beginning of april could bring foreign investors back into the marketplace the market is beginning to feel there may be demand at the beginning of the fiscal year in japan on april 1 quinn said quinn echoed the sentiment of many analysts that there are large amounts of cash waiting to be invested if japanese investment in u s securities does materialize at the start of japan's fiscal year domestic funds may also flow into the bond market he said we could get a stiff rally possibly enough to bring yields on long bonds down to seven to 7 1 8 pct compared to the current yield of about 7 5 pct quinn said in the meantime even the prospect of new supply is not likely to move futures the treasury's announcement of a 15 billion dlr refunding operation did little to move cash government securities prices late wednesday after the close of futures i'd be surprised if supply pushed us out of it the trading range lacey said reuter 3

 canada's major banks will likely face stiff pressure to declare their brazilian loans non performing if as expected major u s banks take similar action after the end of their first quarter tomorrow analysts said american bankers said last week that slow progress in debt talks with brazil increased the likelihood that u s banks would soon declare their brazilian loans non performing such action would put a lot of pressure on the canadian banks to do the same levesque beaubien inc toronto based bank analyst donna pulcine told reuters they banks like to appear to be conservative said pulcine and if a major bank puts loans on a non performing basis and the canadian banks don't there is going to be a lot of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering the loans non performing and another bank is not wood gundy inc bank analyst patricia meredith said any willingness by a major brazilian bank creditor such as citicorp lt cci to declare its brazilian loans non performing rather than let brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling example for other creditor banks in order to make that strategy work they citicorp have to have the support of the other banks said meredith bank analyst michael walsh at first marathon securities ltd said at least one canadian bank which he declined to identify wants to put the brazilian loans on a non performing basis and is trying to encourage the others to take that position canadian banks are owed about seven billion canadian dlrs by brazil which late last month suspended interest payments on its 68 billion u s dlr foreign bank debt banks in canada although allowed to wait up to 180 days before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest as non performing usually move on such loans within 90 days they could therefore delay action on the brazilian loans until late may which falls in canadian banks' third quarter ending july 31 lt bank of montreal brazil's largest canadian bank creditor said last week it was not currently considering declaring its 1 98 billion dlrs of brazilian loans as non performing i think that is just for the benefit of the public walsh said of bank of montreal's statement some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on canadian banks from a move to declare the brazilian loans non performing they said brazil would likely resume interest payments by the banks' fiscal year end on october 31 thus allowing banks to recoup their lost interest income from what brazil has said it is quite likely the banks will get the money said meredith my outlook at this point is optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full year's earnings meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of 3 80 dlrs for lt royal bank of canada compared with 3 74 in 1986 4 30 dlrs for lt bank of montreal compared with 3 59 2 25 dlrs for lt canadian imperial bank of commerce compared with 2 23 2 15 dlrs for lt bank of nova scotia compared with 1 94 and 2 85 dlrs for lt toronto dominion bank against 2 74 she forecast 1 90 dlrs for lt national bank of canada against 3 30 dlrs before a two for one stock split analyst pulcine said she might lower full year earnings estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share assuming a possible settlement reduced brazil's interest costs if the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the fiscal year the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a share but i don't see that as a likely scenario pulcine said walsh at first marathon suggested however that the brazilian debt situation was so complex that it could drag on beyond one full fiscal year he said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings forecasts for the banks he estimated that brazil's yearly interest payments to canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre tax earnings reuter 3

 leaks of a major dutch official economic forecast due to be published on monday indicate reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this year political and market sources say concern over an anticipated fall in dutch competitiveness this year against a background of an average 2 1 2 pct wage increase zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth but whatever the government's response the central bank will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm they say the official forecasting agency centraal planbureau cpb publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and the economy merchant bank pierson heldring en pierson in an estimate reflecting general sentiment said last month that dutch economic growth was now seen around one pct domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in west germany the main dutch trading partner and the lower dollar pierson said in its february economic outlook the latest growth forecasts are well below a 1 5 to two pct growth figure seen by the cpb early last month and forecasts of 2 5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last september the fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of reducing unemployment by an annual 50 000 from 1986 to 1990 some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder employers federation ncw chairman fred lempers criticised the guilder's revaluation in line with the west german mark in last january's european monetary system ems realignment and expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness but the employers federation vno noted the dutch economy had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the dollar was affecting this gain more than the ems realignment some analysts also question the central bank's decision not to copy the latest bundesbank discount rate cut and instead lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge central bank president wim duisenberg has defended the move saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on the money market noting the 4 5 pct discount rate is at the moment not the most important dutch rate because it is already far below the market rates central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of the dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate and interest rate policies serve that goal analysts noted a large capital outflow from the netherlands recently as foreign investments in dutch stock are being sold to take profits loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more dificult to attract foreign capital they said noting dutch interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued completely in line with the mark in a 1983 ems realignment many dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision not to copy the last german discount rate cut but pierson warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder some analysts noted friction between the finance ministry and the central bank with finance minister onno ruding having said before the bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower dutch rates but that the germans should move first one analyst said ruding wanted to bring interest rates down to reduce the government debt burden a finance ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between the ministry and the central bank the cabinet's policy is steady the guilder has to stay with the mark he said reuter 3

 the bank of japan has become increasingly worried about a possible crash of high flying financial markets bank of japan sources said we're afraid that someday the bubble will burst and that the deflationary impact on the economy will be very disastrous one source said they said the central bank has embarked on a delicate policy it wants to deflate the speculation that has pumped up prices sharply in recent months without bursting the bubble stock prices plunged 393 31 points today extending the sharp declines of earlier this month as the market speculated that interest rates would rise the bank of japan bought 100 billion yen in certificates of deposit cds via repurchase agreements today to show its determination to maintain an easy money policy central bank officials said today's cd buying operation was designed to reassure the market the bank has not changed its policy a senior central bank official told reuters there is a possibility that a deflationary impact would permeate the economy if the prices of existing assets collapsed the bank of japan said earlier this month in its annual economic report such a possibility has been heightened by what the bank sees as excessive speculation in stock bond and land prices over the last two years the stock market average has doubled driving price earnings ratios to over 70 compared with about 15 on wall street bond yields have dropped sharply while land prices in tokyo have soared the excessive speculation means the markets are increasingly out of touch with economic reality and thus more vulnerable one central bank source said a collapse now could rob businessmen and consumers of what little confidence they have in the economy after the yen induced recession of the past year private economists said some hard pressed exporters already make greater profits through financial dealings than from their basic businesses they said there seems to be an accelerated demand for money to support transactions in shares bonds land and other existing assets which has little bearing on value added and therefore on gnp the bank of japan said in its report the increased inclination of investors to seek capital gains and the accompanying rise in prices of existing assets could have dangerous implications for the economy it added in the bank's view a major reason behind skyrocketing prices was its own easy monetary policy and the belief in the market that interest rates were heading inexorably lower mindful of the potential inflationary dangers posed by excessive liquidity the central bank's board recently decided it had to spell out clearly to the markets that a further discount rate cut was not in the offing one source said but the bank had to do that without tightening monetary policy and running the risk of a market collapse this was achieved partly by a rise in short term interest rates which bank sources ascribed to seasonal pressures and to a change in market expectations while denying the bank was tightening monetary policy a senior source welcomed the change in market expectations the source acknowledged the shift may have been caused partly by the decision to press commercial banks to limit lending in the july september period faster than expected economic growth and a strong dollar also played a part in the longer run the central bank is counting on a gradual upturn in the economy to draw liquidity from the financial markets into productive areas like capital spending one bank of japan economist said but while it waits for that to occur over the next six months it may have to avoid any overt tightening of monetary policy that could collapse the market and lead to recession reuter 3

 the monetary authorities of the major industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and widespread central bank intervention dealers said the dollar's fall below 150 yen which follows last month's paris currency stabilisation agreement by the u s japan west germany britain france and canada is a dramatic reversal of the success of the group of five g 5 1985 new york plaza meeting to weaken the dollar they said the g 5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on different sides dealers said apparent confusion in the ranks of the g 5 nations has encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite concerted intervention by the central banks of the united states japan britain and west germany they said pleas by japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa for action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by comments by u s treasury secretary james baker that there was no target zone for the dollar the dollar was sold anyway yesterday's comment by baker that he stood by the paris accord did nothing to reverse sentiment dealers said the intervention backed by remarks by fed chairman paul volcker and japanese central bank governor satoshi sumita which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a halt has done little but slow the rate of its decline they noted the situation has again raised the question of whether intervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge currency markets dealers said the market's cool response to intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars this means that the current dollar selling is not of a sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand said koichi miyazaki deputy general manager at sanwa bank dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the intervention and it is only a matter of time before some operators try to push it below 148 yen the dollar closed in tokyo today at 149 40 against new york's 149 30 40 its record low was 148 40 in tokyo last tuesday dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to rise above 150 yen toward early april when the group of seven industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again the market expects the seven nations the paris six plus italy to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies apart from intervention a chief dealer at a u s bank said dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the paris accord nations particulary the u s will remain willing to prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high u s trade deficit especially with japan further pressure from a protectionist u s congress for a lower dollar is also limiting washington's options they said the market now thinks the central bank action is to slow the dollar fall not to push it back over 150 yen said tadahiko nashimoto manager at long term credit bank of japan another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large forward dollar sales from april to june for export bills falling due for japanese exporters from april to september the exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen depreciation dealers said yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the ministry of international trade and industry to restrict dollar sales looks ineffective in light of this real demand they said the market is also anticipating active institutional dollar sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new business year starting april 1 dealers said the market seems to have established a new dollar trading range between 147 and 149 yen one dealer said the dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the paris accord on february 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low end for the dollar against the yen he said some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148 yen it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to 145 reuter 3

 the house of representatives approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if they did not plant the one time pilot 0 92 program designed to assist farmers in kansas oklahoma michigan and parts of missouri was passed by a 304 100 vote and sent to the senate although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0 92 provision endorsed by the reagan administration the u s agriculture department withheld its support from the measure usda said the bill would discourage farmers from buying crop insurance and fall short of the administration's proposed broad scale revision of farm programs the bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the deficiency payments they would have received to be eligible winter wheat farmers could not plant a different crop on that land this spring although they could use the land for grazing or to plant hay usda estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs largely because of reduced crop forfeitures the bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers along the missouri and mississippi rivers who were prevented from planting crops this year because of residual damage from last fall's flooding in addition the measure would require usda to make full payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved by congress last fall currently because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs in appropriated funds usda plans to offer farmers in the region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses the administration said it opposed the bill because by expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief it would thwart efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an alternative to federal disaster assistance usda also said the 0 92 provisions in the bill were narrower than the administration's proposal to offer the option to all major commodities and would produce insignificant savings usda said the 0 92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs while the requirement to compensate fully disaster struck farmers would cost about 135 mln dlrs which must be appropriated by congress the feedgrains provision would cost about five mln dlrs usda estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln dlrs in january the senate approved a bill that would make 1987 winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments but the senate bill would not offer the 0 92 option to wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400 mln dlr ceiling on the disaster assistance program reuter 3

 leading industrial nations will meet again next month to review their accord on currency stability but u s officials said financial markets are convinced for now the countries will live up to commitments to speed up economic growth the narrow currency movements of recent weeks strongly suggests the six leading industrial countries have tamed the normally unruly financial markets and next month's talks seem likely to build on that stability a reagan administration official said the paris agreement last month was the main reason markets were calm but he said in an interview that financial markets also understood that all six countries concluded that the measures to be taken over a period of time in the future should foster stability of exchange rates around current levels that is in fact what has happened since paris monetary analysts said stability has been helped in part by the decision of industrial nations to bury the hatchet and cease to quarrel over short term policy objectives instead they have focused on medium term policy goals but left room to adjust their agreements with periodic meetings the official refused to comment however on whether the agreement included a secret pact to consider further coordinated interest rate cuts a measure industrial nations have taken jointly several times in the past year on february 22 the united states japan west germany france britain and canada agreed that major currencies were within ranges broadly reflecting underlying economic conditions given commitments by washington to cut its budget deficit and by toyko and bonn to boost economic growth the shake up would strengthen the u s position in future international talks i think these changes will strengthen the president's hand politically and the stronger he is politically the better off we are with the congress and the better off we are in international fora said the official an administration economic policymaker so it would be beneficial to the continued conduct of our initiatives but the official also said the administration would resist calls for a tax increase to cut the budget deficit a target europeans say is crucial to help curb economic instability currency analysts believe the paris agreement set secret short term target ranges for their currencies with a specific agreement to defend those bands with intervention according to market sources the ranges agreed were 1 60 to 1 90 marks to the dollar and 140 to 155 yen to the dollar there is no official confirmation that specific bands were set although the agreement used the term ranges for the first time in an international economic agreement the paris accord stated the six would cooperate closely to foster currency stability around current levels last week dealers said the federal reserve intervened to stop the dollar rising against the mark which had breached 1 86 to the dollar british authorities are also understood to have intervened to curb sterling's strength international monetary sources say finance ministers and central bankers who will review market performance and their own economic prospects will reassemble again in washington just before the april 9 policymaking meeting of the international monetary fund the sources said italy which refused to join the paris pact was invited back by treasury secretary james baker since paris there are signs west german growth is slowing while u s officials said they were giving japan until april to show that an economic stimulus package was in the offing signs of concern about german prospects emerged recently when bundesbank central bank president karl otto poehl told bankers he would consider cutting west german interest rates if the fed was ready to follow suit a reagan administration official said this would show there had been some change in approach on the part of the central bank in germany but he declined to comment on the prospects for action by the fed and the bundesbank if there is such a provision it is private and if i talked about it it would no longer be private said the official who asked not to be identified public comments by fed officials suggest the central bank is keeping credit conditions broadly unchanged but if the major economies continue to show sluggish growth and the u s trade deficit remains stubbornly high further coordinated action could be on the april agenda reuter 3

 u s and u k bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry swap dealers said after viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the bank of england and the federal reserve board dealers said that in effect regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by euromoney magazine while no firm figures exist dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement separately the isda estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding kenneth mccormick co chairman of the international swap dealers association isda and president of kleinwort benson cross financing inc said that the association has no comment and will study the proposals what they are proposing is really double counting patrick de saint aignan managing director of swaps for morgan stanley and co said instead he argues banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value say one pct per year to maturity or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default the potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected said a director at one u k merchant bank what they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now to borrow money now to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now he added adds title first paragraph dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement such as those based in japan will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers indeed regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements federal reserve board governor martha seger following approval of the proposed guidelines by the fed said she is concerned that japan was not involved in the u k u s effort to draft new capital rules dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting that is offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other the paper said that regulatory authorities recognize that such arrangements netting may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk furthermore the paper said if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly but dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design one problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market so we don't know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court said one bank official reuter 3

 high labour costs and slower corporate investment could hinder sweden's economic growth after 1987 the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd said the swedish economy grew at a slower rate in 1986 than in previous years gdp rose about 1 7 pct in 1986 compared with 2 2 pct in 1985 but this growth depended largely on external factors particularly lower oil prices the oecd secretariat said in its latest annual report on sweden it warned that labour costs had risen more rapidly in sweden than in other oecd countries because of high labour costs swedish industry which largely relies upon export markets was losing market share wages in the manufacturing sector grew by seven pct in 1986 in line with 1985 increases while public sector wages rose an estimated 9 2 pct in 1986 up from six pct in 1985 this was significantly higher than average wage increases of 3 75 pct for the seven largest members of the oecd in 1986 the report said wage moderation was central to maintaining economic growth in sweden it suggested that wage negotiations should be at least partly centralised to control the total wages bill and hold down inflation and unemployment levels helped by low oil prices and the government's tight fiscal policy inflation fell to just over three pct in 1986 from almost six pct in 1985 but remained higher than in most other oecd countries the report said unemployment a principal policy target was at 2 7 pct in 1986 in line with 1985's 2 8 pct and well below the oecd average of 8 6 pct the report said sweden's employment policies accounted for the high levels of wage inflation it also said that economic growth in 1986 relied increasingly on private consumption because corporate investment in machinery and equipment had shrunk the total volume of industrial investments dropped by two pct in 1986 with sharp declines in spending by the wood pulp and paper industries this compared to a 19 pct rise in 1985 when there was heavy investment in these industries the oecd said sweden should now make an effort to boost corporate investments and reduce its dependence on domestic consumption for economic growth it suggested there was room for reform in the tax system sweden should continue to cut public sector spending especially in local government to keep in line with its tighter fiscal policy the report said reuter 3

 central bank money stock was growing at about seven pct in the first quarter of 1987 down from 9 1 2 pct in the second half of 1986 so there are signs that the pace of growth is slowing even though it is still above target the bundesbank said in its 1986 annual report the bundesbank set a target range of three to six pct growth from fourth quarter 1986 to fourth quarter 1987 for central bank money stock in the previous year it grew 7 7 pct outside the 3 1 2 to 5 1 2 pct target range the bundesbank noted that monetary policy in 1986 was limited by a series of external factors these included the revaluation of the mark growing foreign payments surpluses of non banks and currency inflows the bundesbank therefore tolerated the monetary overshoot in 1986 as an attempt to counter monetary expansion with interest rate and liquidity moves would have increased upward pressure on the mark it said the lower end of the 1987 target range would be realistic if a large part of funds currently held in a liquid form were invested in long term bank accounts or bonds public bonds or foreign securities the bundesbank said but if companies and private households continue to hold their funds in liquid forms or if there are further currency inflows growth will be closer to the upper end of the range the more the conflict between external constraints and domestic objectives relaxes and many things point to this at the time of writing this report the more possible it will be to do justice again to the medium term concept of money supply control the bundesbank said it noted that prices were beginning to tend upwards again at the start of 1987 there would be virtually no easing of other production costs in 1987 to compensate for the rise in unit wage costs nevertheless no inflationary trends are likely to set in this year the bundesbank said a link between excessive monetary growth and intensifying price rises can only be observed in the long term it added the continuing trend for non banks to switch into long term borrowing to take advantage of low interest rates while for the same reason shunning long term investments increases the risks in changing interest rates for banks refinancing themselves with variable interest deposits it added reuter 3

should be calculated this week many of the same experts gather in the same building here to try to agree on how the cocoa pact reached last summer should work the still unresolved legal wrangle surrounding the international tin council itc which had buffer stock losses running into hundreds of millions of sterling is also casting a shadow over commodity negotiations the itc's failure has restricted negotiators' ability to compromise as governments do not want to be involved in pacts with built in flaws or unlimited liability but want clear lines drawn between aid and trade a more hopeful sign of cooperation was agreement on basic elements of a new international natural rubber agreement in geneva at the weekend some importing countries insist the international cocoa organization icco buffer stock rules must not be muddied with quota type subclauses which might dictate the type of cocoa to be bought one consumer country delegate said this would distort not support the market trade and industry sources blame uncertainty about the icco for destabilising the market as the recent collapse in coffee prices has made traders acutely aware that commodity pacts can founder on friday this uncertainty helped push london cocoa futures down to eight month lows the strength of sterling has also contributed to the recent slip in prices the icco daily and average prices on friday fell below the must buy level of 1 600 sdrs a tonne designated in the pact which came into force at the last icco session in january but without rules for the operation of the buffer stock consumers and producers could not agree on how it should operate and what discretion it should be given the agreement limits it to trading physical cocoa and expressly says it cannot operate on futures markets a cash balance of some 250 mln dlrs and a stock of almost 100 000 tonnes of cocoa enough to mount large buying or selling operations were carried forward from the previous agreement members finance the stock through a 45 dlrs a tonne levy on all cocoa they trade it has an upper limit of 250 000 tonnes the key arguments being faced by the icco working group on buffer stock rules which is meeting today and tomorrow will be over non member cocoa and differentials the buffer stock should pay when trading different types of cocoa another working group is scheduled to meet wednesday to discuss administrative matters and the full council meets on thursday producers have so far maintained that buffer stock funds should not help mop up surplus cocoa produced in non member countries such as malaysia consumers say when this cocoa is the cheapest the buffer stock should buy it rather than compete with chocolate manufacturers for premium priced high quality cocoas the argument over buying non member cocoa is closely linked to the one over differentials for different qualities european industry and trade advisers have suggested as a compromise that the buffer stock have a maximum share that can represent non member cocoa and that it use the london futures market's existing differentials for different qualities currently good west african cocoa is tendered at par onto the london market discounts which are currently under review range up to 50 stg a tonne for brazilian and malaysian cocoa consumer delegates said the same arguments in reverse would operate when prices are high the buffer stock should sell the highest priced cocoa in most demand forcing all prices lower the january talks were slowed by a split inside the european community a key icco consumer group with france siding with producers ec representatives met in closed session in brussels on friday in an attempt to reach a common ground and a diplomatic source said narrowed the range of positions among the 12 nations the source said the ec will be looking for signs of flexibility on the part of producers in the next few days and will be able to respond if they are there one icco delegate describing the producer consumer split said consumer proposals mean buying more cocoa for less and backs the concept of the pact which is meant to support the market where trade buying is not in contrast he said producers seem to want to sell their cocoa to the buffer stock rather than consumers other more technical issues still outstanding include whether the buffer stock should buy at a single announced posted price as in the previous pact or by announcing it is buying then accepting offers in either case delegates said it is accepted that producers must be given a clear opportunity to make offers of cocoa for forward shipment directly to the buffer stock in a way that is competitive with spot offers made by dealers reuter 3

 a study on grain certificates due out shortly from the government accounting office gao could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays administration and industry sources said analysis that the gao has obtained from the agriculture department and the office of management and budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments a gao official told reuters gao is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of sen jesse helms r n c former chairman of the senate agriculture committee the report which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash is scheduled to be released in mid march the cost of certificates said the gao source depends on the program's impact on the usda loan program if gao determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures then the net cost of the program would go up however if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease the cost effect of certificates would be less gao will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded the gao official said but a negative report on certificates will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program an agricultural consultant said the omb is said to be against any expansion of the program while usda remains firmly committed to it reuter 3

 the international cocoa organization icco buffer stock working group began examining a draft proposal for buffer stock rules this afternoon delegates said the plan presented by icco executive director kobena erbynn represented a compromise between producer european community ec and other consumer views on how the buffer stock should operate they said the proposal involved three key principles first the buffer stock manager would be open to offers for cocoa rather than using fixed posted prices as previously delegates said under an offer system the buffer stock manager would be free to choose cocoas of varying prices they said the second provision was that non icco member cocoa could comprise a maximum 10 pct of the buffer stock while the third laid out a pricing system under which the buffer stock manager would pay differentials for different grades of cocoa to be set by a formula the delegates said after the plan was presented working group delegates met briefly in smaller groups of producers ec consumers and all consumers to look at the proposal producers gave no reaction to the scheme and will respond to it when the working group meets tomorrow at 1000 gmt producer delegates said consumer members accepted the proposal as a good base to work from one consumer delegate said delegates said the proposal was only a starting point for negotiations on buffer stock rules and subject to change reuter 3

 failure of talks on re establishing international coffee organization ico coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the united states particularly the state department to reassess its position but the u s is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by objective criteria u s officials said jon rosenbaum assistant u s trade representative and head of washington's delegation to the talks told reuters on his return from london that the united states is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as april if necessary rosenbaum said the united states will be flexible in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas at the ico talks major consuming nations led by the u s proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks while large producers led by brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares the consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of brazil by far the world's largest producer rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before congress which would allow the u s customs service to monitor coffee imports as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas he said the reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the london talks but nobody is proposing we change our position however other u s government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries led by brazil and colombia to soften the consumer position knowing that its next crop is fairly large brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers said one u s official the u s official who asked not to be identified said brazil and colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in london this in turn could lead to urgent appeals from latin american countries faced with mounting debt problems to the u s state department and to the national security council in the white house for an easing of the u s position u s officials said the state department a major player in setting u s coffee policy may then face conflicting pressures particularly from politically sensitive u s allies in central america u s officials said el salvador and guatemala both backed brazil and colombia at the london talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria but the dominican republic and costa rica joined the splinter group which said it would agree to objective criteria there is a strong feeling among some in the state department that the united states should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically risky step of opposing brazil on the objective criteria question u s officials said within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions in london the u s was supported by the u k the netherlands west germany japan australia and new zealand on the issue of objective criteria u s officials said this bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals however u s sources said west germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the european community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks france backed the ivory coast and other african producers during the talks a softening of the ec stance would make it more difficult although not impossible for the u s to block producer plans while political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important u s officials said the key to any future outcome will be brazil's position u s officials blamed brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement reuter 3

 energy secretary john herrington has proposed several ways to boost u s oil production but he said all would cost the treasury money and will come under close white house scrutiny before action is taken one measure he said he favored would raise the depletion allowance to 27 5 pct on new oil and gas production as well as production using enhanced extraction methods herrington said such a plan would cost 200 mln dlrs a year the white house reacting said it did not favor amending the tax code but would look at the proposal herrington's proposals to spur production were made along with the release last week of the energy department's report on energy and the national security the report said u s oil imports rapidly rising could hit 50 pct by the mid 1990s and have potentially damaging implications for national security he has said since in speeches and at news conferences that any plan he would back to spur lagging domestic oil production would have to meet three criteria increase production not cause economic dislocation and be low cost to the taxpayer herrington said an import fee would meet the first test spurring production but fail the second and third he said it would raise production and return 120 000 oil workers to their jobs but at the same time it lifted oil prices the higher prices would cost 400 000 jobs nationwide and cut the gross national product by 32 billion dlrs a tax on gasoline he said would fail the first criteria by not increasing domestic production in any case u s officials say president reagan remains firmly opposed to an import fee and a gasoline tax options which meet herrington's criteria include loan price guarantees to shield banks from defaults by borrowers because of lower oil prices it was estimated that if oil fell to five dlrs a barrel it could trigger defaults that could cost the government an estimated 15 billion dlrs a five pct tax credit for exploration and development it would raise oil and gas production the equivalent of 325 000 barrels a day at a cost of 740 mln dlrs a year a five pct credit only for geological and geophysical expenditures it would increase production by 80 000 barrels a day at a cost of 65 mln dlrs lower bid minimums on outer continental shelf acreage to spur exploration a drop from the present 150 dlrs per acre for the typical 5 760 acre tract to 25 dlrs per acre would lower the cost of the standard tract lease to 144 000 dlrs herrington also pressed anew for existing administration proposals to deregulate natural gas which he said would cut the need for imported oil by 300 000 barrels daily he also called again for congressional approval to explore off the continental shelf which may hold more than 12 billion barrels of oil and the arctic national wildlife refuge which may hold nine billion barrels herrington said he understood the reagan's reluctance to amend the newly enacted tax code to fund some of these proposals but added he hoped his department's energy security study would make a strong case for the need to help the struggling domestic oil industry another move herrington said he will press anew even though it had been rejected earlier by the white house is to raise the fill rate for the strategic petroleum reserve to 100 000 barrels a day from its planned 1988 rate of 35 000 this he said would further bolster national security in case of an oil supply disruption reuter 3

 argentine grain growers reduced their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current harvest in the week to yesterday trade sources said soybean production for 1986 87 is now estimated to reach between 7 7 and eight mln tonnes versus 7 8 to 8 2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago and eight to 8 4 mln tonnes estimated in mid february but even the lowest of those estimates would be 8 5 to 12 7 pct greater than last year's total of 7 1 mln tonnes according to official figures and would be a new record the total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a record 3 7 to 3 8 mln hectares and increased 10 8 to 13 8 pct compared to the 3 3 mln hectares planted last year the change in yield estimates is due to very high temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in the soybean producing belt of southern cordoba and santa fe and northern buenos aires province the heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean pods empty especially in cordoba intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops since rainfall was slight in most main soybean producing areas rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in buenos aires province totalling between one and 10 mm there was no recorded rain in other grain producing provinces with clear skies and seasonable temperatures fields were able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent weeks allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize sunflower and sorghum harvesting crops were considered in generally good condition though it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of recent weeks caused any long term damage the maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the total area planted compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at 3 58 to 3 78 mln hectares down two to seven pct from the 3 85 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest total production for the current maize harvest is expected to reach between 9 9 and 10 1 mln tonnes versus 10 to 10 2 mln tonnes estimated a week ago the new figure is 21 1 to 22 7 pct lower than the 12 8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest according to official figures the sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of total planted area versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two to 2 2 mln hectares or 29 9 to 36 3 pct lower than the record 3 14 mln hectares planted in the 1985 86 harvest the current harvest's volume was again expected to be between 2 3 and 2 6 mln tonnes or 34 1 to 41 5 pct lower than last harvest's record 4 1 mln tonnes yields varied widely from area to area and growers feared that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on crops and consequently on total production volume the sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of total planted area compared to four to six pct a week ago total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1 2 and 1 3 mln hectares or 10 3 to 15 2 pct lower than the 1 4 mln hectares planted in the previous harvest estimates for total sorghum production this harvest remained at 3 2 to 3 5 mln tonnes again this week or 16 7 to 22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4 1 to 4 2 mln tonnes reuter 3

 coffee prices look set to continue sliding in the near term given the lack of progress towards a new international coffee organization ico export quota accord according to coffee traders and analysts robusta coffee futures dipped sharply to 4 1 2 year lows yesterday at 1 220 stg per tonne basis the may position when the lack of new debate on quotas at ico talks here confirmed expectations that efforts to restore quotas would not be revived at this stage they said the 15 day ico average composite price fell to 99 69 cents a lb for april 1 the lowest for 5 1 2 years quotas will not now be renegotiated before the ico's annual september council session and in the interim the brazilian frost season from june to august may prove the only bullish factor to stem further price weakness they said futures bounced back from the lows today towards the previous trading range around 1 260 1 270 stg per tonne on may as the market recovered from yesterday's confidence blip one trader commented but despite today's upturn the overall trend is for lower prices in the near future one trade source said the market had become increasingly vulnerable to yesterday's shakeout having held within a 1 250 1 350 stg second position trading range for 22 successive sessions he said technically the market is more likely to decline further as it absorbs today's brief rally steep declines towards the 1 100 1 050 stg area could foster a three figure mentality and speculators may elect to push for coffee prices below the psychological 1 000 stg level he added some traders said today's upturn was in part due to brazil's opening last night of may green coffee export registrations this had been widely anticipated by the market and came as no surprise but it did remove some prevailing uncertainty and light trade buying was seen this morning as a consequence however the overall trend remains downwards and a test of support at 1 200 stg should be expected soon with the only possible supportive influence on the horizon being the approach of brazil's frost season they said roasters are believed to be well covered limiting activities to modest hand to mouth purchases and generally not taking up producer offers they added central american producers have sold the bulk of their current crops but robusta producers in west africa and indonesia need to sell coffee for april through july shipment and this could pressure prices further traders said however one dealer although seeing no reason to be bullish advised caution everybody's bearish now just as they were bullish when the market was at 3 100 stg he said arthur cherry coffee analyst at e d and f man expressed doubts the price spiral would continue much below current levels one dlr coffee is catastrophic for many producers there must be a minimum below which prices cannot fall while prices dropped to the lowest levels since september 1982 yesterday manufacturers have no plans to cut their retail prices its impossible to say we can't predict anything like that at this stage a general foods spokesman said manufacturers have lowered prices recently anyway in response to market weakness at the beginning of march the price of a 100 gram jar of coffee was cut to 1 55 stg from 1 65 stg in britain but should coffee market prices continue to fall the situation would be reviewed the spokesman added nestle also has no plans to make additional price cuts in the near future the market seems to have established some equilibrium and doesn't look set to go much lower a nestle spokesman commented coffee's plunge this week has been mirrored by tea which fell to a 5 1 2 year low at today's auction at 1 18 stg per kilo for medium quality traders added reuter 3

 santa fe southern pacific corp may have more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a possible takeover by henley group lt heng which has accumulated almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad conglomerate analysts said takeover speculation has surrounded santa fe since henley disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week but analysts and a santa fe official were skeptical a takeover is its intention analysts also said the company has strong defenses that would easily deter any suitor one of those being its problems combining its two railroad properties which hang in regulatory limbo richard fischer of merrill lynch and co inc said that santa fe at december 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash equivalents while its long term debt to capital was just over 25 pct this gives them plenty of borrowing power he said which could be used against an unwanted suitor henley group's chairman michael dingman has said he wants to take major positions in undervalued natural resource companies he also told reuters in an interview he is seeking an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs santa fe officials don't appear concerned that henley might launch a takeover i would not characterize the atmosphere around here as one of concern one santa fe executive said about henley i think it's wrong to assume dingman has formed a firm strategy with santa fe said mark hassenberg who covers henley for dlj securities analysts say the potential of santa fe's land assets are likely to be realized slowly they add that santa fe's efforts to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable future these realities they said support the henley group's statement that its santa fe stake is only an investment the more pressing problem facing santa fe is overcoming difficulties in merging its two railroads the atchison topeka and santa fe railway co and southern pacific transportation co the merger would create the nation's second longest railroad last july the interstate commerce commission icc denied the merger on anticompetitive grounds the company since has granted trackage sharing rights to four western railroads to meet the icc's concerns and persuade it to reopen the hearings in its three year old struggle to merge the lines my guess is the commission will decide in three to six weeks whether to reopen hearings fischer said i believe they've made an effort to satisfy the icc's objections he said but in doing so they haven't pleased everyone before they had burlington northern on their side now burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set up if the hearings are reopened analysts predicted it will take six to nine months for everyone to have their say and up to another year for the icc to decide santa fe is in the midst of a 50 mln share stock buyback program begun in 1984 it has bought back 33 7 mln shares as of february 1 when it had 154 7 mln shares outstanding a spokesman said among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by norfolk southern one of 3 4 mln shares bought in 1986 and another of 1 7 mln shares in 1985 one analyst said james voytko at paine webber believes santa fe could fight off the henley group with its cash and credit citing the share buybacks from norfolk southern he said one of santa fe's options if threatened could be to buy the henley stake it is indeed possible that dingman sees this as a low risk opportunistic investment voytko said people who follow santa fe have given me values of 45 dlrs to 50 dlrs a share said dlj securities' hassenberg but i'm certain that in dingman's mind the company is worth more than that in breakup value reuter 3

 the brazilian coffee institute ibc is expected to maintain its previous pricing system when it reopens export registrations probably later this week exporters said they said ibc president jorio dauster is likely to leave the basic formula for the minimum registration price unchanged but raise the contribution quota to partially offset the effects of cruzado devaluation since april registrations were closed in mid february to fully compensate for devaluation the quota would have to be around 28 dlrs per bag against 7 0 when registrations closed however even a 21 dlr per bag rise in the contribution quota would make brazil coffees uncompetitive on world markets and an increase to around 15 dlrs a bag is more likely the exporters said they added that dauster is keen to raise the contribution quota as the institute needs money to repay central governmnet funds released to finance ibc purchases at the guaranteed producer price although a vote in the monetary council to provide more funds for such purchases was deferred on technical grounds last week funds are still being released for subsequent approval the sources said it is still unclear when registrations will be reopened although most expect it to be by the end of this week brazil owes it to its customers to make its intentions know a country like brazil cannot afford to be permanently closed down one exporter said however before announcing its export policy the ibc is likely to wait to see if tomorrow's meeting of the international coffee organisation ico executive board in london decides to call a full council meeting to discuss reintroduction of export quotas sources said there is also talk of the announcement this week of new measures to adjust the brazilian economy and the ibc could be awaiting clarification before making any move the exporters said another factor which could be delaying the opening of registrations is the current strike by bank workers which while not affecting current shipments could affect documentation and currency operations for new sales this would certainly be the case if the ibc was considering obliging exporters to pay the contribution quota within two or three days of registering a sale 3

 the london metal exchange's lme decision to introduce a dollar denominated aluminium contract with the port of singapore listed as a delivery point is a positive move physical traders and lme dealers said earlier this week the lme declared that a 99 70 pct minimum purity aluminium contract would commence trading on june 1 1987 alongside its long established sterling based 99 50 pct contract this is the lme's first dollar contract and non european delivery point and the board and committee are looking at singapore as a delivery point for other contracts trade sources said the lme's new contract will conform with existing industry practice where 99 70 standard re melt material priced in dollars is most commonly traded the location of a warehouse in singapore is also a positive move by the lme given its ideal location for australian and japanese traders who would be able to place metal on to warrant speedily and relatively inexpensively they said hedging during the lme ring sessions becomes much simpler with a dollar contract at present pre market trading is almost exclusively dollar based but currency conversions have to be done during the sterling rings they added lme ring dealers said the new contract would match more closely trade requirements and possibly alleviate some of the recent wide backwardations very little physical business is now done in 99 50 pct purity metal nearly all of which is produced in eastern bloc countries such as romania the soviet union also produces 99 50 pct but has declined as an exporter recently they said some dealers said the new 99 70 contract may suffer from liquidity problems initially as business may continue to centre on the present good ordinary brand gob contract where there are many holders of large short positions on the lme but others said the new contract would soon attract trading interest given that much 99 70 metal has already been attracted to the lme's warehouses by backwardations the lme also has a much more viable liquidity base for a new contract compared to the comex market in new york where high grade aluminium futures are not particularly active they said thus it seems likely that the sterling contract will eventually lose trading interest and volumes will decline like standard zinc which was superseded by a high grade contract gob aluminium will probably be replaced although the process in this case may take longer they added forming a new contract and establishing a singapore warehouse are constructive moves by the lme but backwardations which make physical trading difficult would not totally disappear as a result the trade sources said these premiums for prompt metal have become a semi permanent feature over the last year due to increased business and volatility in traded options and are presently around 50 stg increasingly large granting of option positions has been taking place when some of these are declared and exercised at the end of the relevant month physical tightness and squeezes around these dates are commonplace they said listing singapore as a delivery point allows far eastern operators to deliver aluminium into a lme warehouse instead of having to cover but tightness and backwardations are seen continuing even though the lme's new option contracts widen the gap between the declaration and prompt dates these will be due on the first and third wednesday of the month whereas at present most fall on the 20th and 25th backwardations will remain while operators continue to grant options where potential tonnage to be delivered exceeds aluminium stock levels an lme option trader said reuter 3

 south africa is expected to unveil tomorrow an expansionary budget for the second consecutive year in a bid to boost the nation's flagging economic growth rate economic analysts said faced with competing demands for increased military and police spending and the pressing need for more funds for black housing and education finance minister barend du plessis is expected to raise significantly the government's overall expenditure targets when he presents the budget to parliament the analysts said analysts expect du plessis to provide for a rise in state spending at least equal to the 16 pct inflation rate for the financial year that started on april 1 while ignoring pleas from the private sector to stimulate growth by cutting taxes fiscal policy has become gradually more expansionary but simply raising government spending and increasing the budget deficit is an inflationary form of stimulation said rob lee chief economist at south african mutual life assurance co south africa this year is targeting inflation adjusted growth in gdp of three pct against an increase last year of less than one pct growth in gdp over the past decade has averaged about 1 5 pct while the unemployment rate among blacks has spiralled to over 30 pct economists estimate that the government's spending target will rise to about 47 billion rand with revenue budgeted at around 40 billion rand this would leave a budget deficit before borrowing of about seven billion rand or four pct of gdp the government having consistently overshot its own spending targets for more than a decade also faces a credibility crisis over expenditure figures outlined in the budget analysts said the budget is invariably too optimistic on expenditure said standard bank ltd in a budget preview many analysts in the private sector are now paying less attention to the figures presented in the budget and are using their own estimates of expenditure to draw conclusions for the money and capital markets south african mutual's lee believes government spending will again exceed the budget target and increase to around 49 billion rand this year leaving a deficit of between 5 and 5 5 pct of gdp compared with a three pct limit suggested by the imf the imf limit is obviously going to be abandoned predicted one analyst noting that south africa has moved steadily away from austerity measures recommended by the imf over the past two years the policy shift followed a dramatic deterioration in the political situation and the onset of an economic crisis triggered by the refusal of major foreign banks to roll over loans to the country in september 1985 against a background of western economic sanctions falling per capita incomes rising joblessness and high inflation government officials say economic growth is the prime objective but private sector economists caution that the government's ability to promote growth by boosting state spending is constrained by the need to maintain a large surplus on the current account of the country's balance of payments most of that surplus this year estimated at around 2 5 billion dlrs will be swallowed up by repayments on the nation's estimated 23 billion dlr foreign debt in terms of an arrangement reached earlier this year with major international creditor banks within these constraints economists believe du plessis has little room to manoeuvre analysts argue recent rises in civil service salaries and budgeted spending increases for the state owned post office and south african transport services suggest that major tax concessions to individuals or corporations are unlikely du plessis earlier this year announced small concessions for taxpayers in a mini budget before the may 6 whites only election the poll delayed presentation of the national budget this will not be a very exciting budget commented harry schwarz spokesman on finance for the liberal progressive federal party i do not expect any major tax cuts as all the sweets were given out before the election reuter 3

 three geographically diverse droughts in asia are being linked by some scientists to a reintensification of the complex and little understood el nino weather pattern lt accu weather inc a commercial weather forecasting service said rice and wheat farmers in china wheat and sugarcane growers in australia and tea planters in sri lanka all face serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive in time to break the droughts offical reports government officials and meteorologists said wen wei po a hong kong daily with close peking links said the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months rice planting is threatened in eight provinces it added rainfall in the key farming provinces of henan and sichuan was 70 pct below average during february the lowest figure for over 20 years the paper said the dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct compared with last march and lowered the water levels of many rivers it added this has resulted in reduced hydro electric power causing shortages to industry and households the upper reaches of the yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century causing many ships to run aground wen wei po said unusually high temperatures have also been reported across china media reports said the people's daily said sichuan has recorded temperatures three degrees celsius higher than average since early february the new china news agency said the average december temperature in harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher than last december and 14 degrees higher than december 1984 severe drought is affecting about one third of sri lanka and threatens to reduce the country's tea crop ministry of plantation industries officials told reuters in australia concern is growing about below average rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the queensland coast and in western australia's wheat belt local meteorological bureau officials said for many farmers and government officials the fear is that while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major threat the prospect of a dry autumn winter season when the wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does they added concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982 83 drought which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as el nino they said although meteorologists are cautious about linking the asia pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any single cause el nino's role is being closely studied they said accu weather inc which specialises in providing data for agriculture and shipping interests said each el nino 'event' was unique the el nino does not always produce the same effects and the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last major event in 1982 83 it said el nino spanish for christ child because it appears around christmas is formed by the action of warm air bearing clouds and rain shifting from the indonesian archipelago to the coast of peru where it mingles with the cold waters associated with the peru current and returns across the pacific as the trade winds meteorologists said the winds strengthened by el nino's pump effect raise the sea level off australia and indonesia they said when the winds drop the ocean seeking equilibrium sends a surge of warmer water back across the pacific where it collides with the cold seas off peru they said one effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the rain bearing clouds away from australia and indonesia into the pacific where they further disrupt other weather patterns the prospects for an end to the droughts vary accu weather said china where the affected areas have received between 40 and 75 pct of normal rainfall will have to wait for the may september rains it said the may september rains normally provide the drought striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall in australia areas of queensland's coastal strip have received less than half the normal rainfall during the current wet season but prospects for increased rains are diminishing as the rainy season draws to an end in sri lanka the drought has come when rainfall should be at its maximum for the year the year's secondary rains usually occur between april and june although it is not possible at this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual reuter 3

 french industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy the organisation for economic cooperation and development said with gross domestic product likely to grow only 2 1 pct this year the same rate as last year unemployment could climb to 11 5 pct of the workforce by mid 1988 from its present 10 9 pct it said in an annual review of the french economy the report said the french economy was increasingly ill adapted to demand selling goods at uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets france's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average and a substantial loss of market share in the past 18 months it said pointing to a likely widening of the french trade deficit to around 2 9 billion dlrs this year from 2 4 billion in 1986 it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to a renewed loss of competitiveness relative not only to the united states but also to the newly industrialised countries this could result in further major losses of market share particularly in the non oecd area which accounts for almost a quarter of french exports it said until the competitive ability of industry improved the authorities would have little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly it added but rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next the oecd said written mainly in december last year the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987 and a 0 9 pct surge in january consumer prices caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs we took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost one oecd official commented oecd officials said the january data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2 5 or three pct the government last week revised its forecast up to between 2 4 and 2 5 pct from two pct against last year's 2 1 pct but the oecd backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation with french unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the oecd area the inflation differential between france and its main trading rival west germany could fall to just one pct this year it said on the other hand the report noted consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits for the disinflationary process to continue and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability it is essential that wage restraint continue it said reuter 3
